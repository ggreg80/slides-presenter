## Slides presenter plugin for IntelliJ IDEs

This is a plugin to show slides and code example directly from IDE.

 - Keep your code examples always up-to-date and save time by not copying code into slides. 
 - Run code examples live to show how the code works and that it's all real.
 - Make transition between slides and code snippets as smooth as possible.
 
Built-in presentation mode in IJ IDEs does almost the right thing. 
However, there is no way to open images full screen 
(there is always a panel at the top and background colour which doesn't match your slides)
and you there is no way to define a sequence of slides.
